title: "Improved MeSH analysis software tools for farm animals"
summary: "The Medical Subject Headings, also known as MeSH, is a controlled life sciences vocabulary
maintained by the National Library of Medicine to index journal articles. These headings
are manually curated at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and used in the
MEDLINE database accessible from PubMed. By mapping MeSH IDs to Entrez Gene IDs,
MeSH turns into a powerful resource for enrichment analysis. In 2014, we developed MeSH
annotation Bioconductor packages for over 80 species coupled with a MeSH enrichment
analysis package that initially became available from Bioconductor 2.14 (April 2014). We
reported the first detailed MeSH enrichment analysis of cattle, swine, horse, and chicken
accompanied by reproducible R code to perform MeSH analysis. A unique aspect of
MeSH is that the quantity and quality of annotations are driven by new knowledge that is
disseminated via peer-reviewed scientific articles. In other words, MeSH analysis can be
viewed as a community-driven annotation project that is expected to improve over time as
more scientific articles get published. Recently, the MeSH framework went through a major
change starting from Bioconductor 3.14 (October 2021), resulting in the previous R code
being no longer functional. Thus, the objective of this work was to report the improvement
of MeSH annotations over past years since the initial release in 2014 and update the animal
genetics community regarding the new usage of MeSH Bioconductor packages."
