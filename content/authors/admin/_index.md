I'm an Animal Scientist, MSc in Genetics and Animal Breeding, and currently a Ph.D. Student in the Animal and Poultry Sciences Department at Virginia Tech. My research interest include quantitative genetic and image analyses of high-throughput phenotyping data. My overarching research interest is to understand the genotype-phenotype map in livestock species using bioinformatics, statistical genetics, and functional genomics. I’m interested in better understanding the genetic architecture of economically important traits, and also apply and develop statistical methods for prediction in the multi-omics era.
