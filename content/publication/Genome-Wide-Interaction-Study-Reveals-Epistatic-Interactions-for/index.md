abstract: "Gene-gene interactions cause hidden genetic variation in natural populations and could be responsible for the lack of replication that is typically observed in complex traits studies. This study aimed to identify gene-gene interactions using the empirical Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) method to test for epistasis in beef fatty acid profile traits Nellore cattle. The dataset contained records from 963 bulls, genotyped using 777,962k SNP chip. Meat samples of Longissimus muscle, were taken to measure fatty acids composition that was quantified by gas chromatography. We chose to work with the sum of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsaturated (PUFA), omega-3 (OM3), omega-6 (OM6), SFA:PUFA and OM3:OM6 fatty acid ratios. The SNP in the interactions P<10^(-8) were mapped individually, and used to search for candidate genes. A total of 602, 3, 13, 23, 13, 215 and 169 candidate genes for SFA, MUFA, PUFA, OM3, OM6, SFA: PUFA, and OM3:OM6 ratios were identified, respectively. The candidate genes found were associated to cholesterol, lipid regulation, low-density lipoprotein receptors, feed efficiency and inflammatory response. Enrichment analysis revealed 57 significant GO and 18 KEGG terms (P < 0.05), most of them related to meat quality and complementary terms.  Our results showed substantial genetic interactions associated with lipid profile, meat quality, carcass and feed efficiency traits for the first time in Nellore cattle. The knowledge of these SNP-SNP interactions could improve the understanding of the genetic and physiological mechanisms that contribute to the lipid-related traits and improve human health by the selection of healthier meat products."
